## Dataset

Data set can be downloaded from kaggle . 

## Data Preprocessing
Load data from the markdown file.
Explore and understand the data.
Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables.
Scale numerical features.
Perform feature engineering if needed.
Handle outliers.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Address imbalanced data if applicable.
Normalize data if necessary.
Ensure data is in the right format for the model.
Save preprocessing information for deployment.




## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Share insights gained from exploratory data analysis. Use visualizations and summary statistics to highlight key patterns or trends in the data.

## Model Training

Describe the machine learning model(s) used for diabetes prediction. Include information about the algorithm, hyperparameters, and any other relevant details. If applicable, discuss the model selection process.

## Model Evaluation

Present the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of your model(s). Include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and any other relevant metrics. Discuss the results and any potential areas for improvement.
